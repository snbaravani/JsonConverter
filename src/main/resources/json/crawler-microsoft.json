      "Table: Table_1\n\n,A look ahead from Lucas Joppa This must be a decade of ambition paired with action. At Microsoft, we appreciate the urgency, responsibility, risks, and opportunities ahead. For Microsoft to do well, we need the world to do well. This belief is why our mission is to empower every person on the planet to achieve more, and why our CEO, Satya Nadella, stated, \"the purpose of a corporation is to find profitable solutions to problems of people and the planet.\" Unfortunately, 2020 brought an array of new challenges to this already complex work. COVID-19 has devastated human lives in every corner of the globe, while climate change caused unprecedented environmental and economic damages. While vaccines are becoming available as a solution for COVID-19, solutions for climate change will require deploying a host of different tools to combat the many drivers of climate change. For the survival of people and our planet, this is a battle we can't afford to lose. This will require the dedication of individuals, organizations, and governments, all focused on stabilizing Earth's climate and properly managing its natural resources. We have a limited amount of time to accomplish what will be the most significant behavioral and technological societal transformation in modern human history. By 2030, society must be well on its way to mitigating and adapting to rapidly changing climates, ensuring resilient water supplies, reducing the amount of waste we generate, and reversing the ongoing and catastrophic degradation of ecosystems while halting the extinction of species. That is why this must be a decade of ambition paired with action. At Microsoft we appreciate the urgency, responsibility, risks, and opportunities ahead. That is why a little over a year ago we began a process to transform our company's work on sustainability to better align with the scope, scale, and speed of the world's environmental challenges and yet-to-be created solutions. , \"Addressing six enabling conditions will ultimately dictate the success or failure of the sustainability agenda this decade-for Microsoft and the world.' Dr. Lucas Joppa, Chief Environmental Officer 2030 By 2030, Microsoft will remove more carbon than it emits. By 2050, we will remove all historical emissions. , Six enabling conditions As we worked to set and implement our commitments to become carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste and to deploy a Planetary Computer, some of these global challenges came into sharp focus. There is a suite of enabling conditions that must exist for Microsoft and the world to effectively and efficiently achieve a more sustainable and just future. The enabling conditions that we must address inside Microsoft are clear-broadening and strengthening our governance and accountability frameworks while building a culture of sustainability investment and innovation. But it will be the creation of six enabling conditions outside Microsoft that will ultimately dictate success or failure of the sustainability agenda. Resolving or improving these conditions will ensure a coherent, coordinated, cost-efficient approach to individual and collective action on climate change. Risk recognition Without a holistic assessment of risk, it is difficult for companies to efficiently manage their sustainability challenges. Unfortunately, the scale and societal interdependencies of climate risk make a comprehensive assessment difficult. While many important efforts are underway, there is not yet an exhaustive framework for risk assessment for businesses. By 2030, a widely adopted and comprehensive risk framework will need to be in place to ensure every business can fully integrate environmental risk at the core of their corporate governance process. ,\n",

The Microsoft Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) program's Business Continuity Standard and Service Resilience Standard identify the baseline requirements for implementing business continuity disaster recovery and overall resilience at Microsoft, to help ensure our capability of recovery and preparedness in the event of a major or catastrophic business disruption that affects our ability to meet customer expectations. At an asset level, business groups within our operating segments have their own processes. In FY19, we initiated quantitative and qualitative physical (medium-term) and transition (long-term) risk and opportunity assessments for key Microsoft regions. In addition, we are assessing our alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to ensure we are properly managing these risks and opportunities within our business and adequately planning for the future.* , disclosures not included in 2020 CDP Response ,\nImpact of climate- related risks and opportunities The ES team brings leaders from across the company together to align on management decisions to mitigate, transfer, accept, or control the identified climate-related risks and opportunities. To make decisions on risk, we use our enterprise risk management (ERM) risk prioritization criteria in the context of business continuity and service resilience, which include the scope of impact (e.g. reputational, regulatory, and cost), potential return on investment, and time and resources required to implement changes. The EBCM program works with the ERM program to ensure consistent alignment among risks and risk prioritization criteria and, ultimately, the final risk ratings. In FY19, we committed to powering our datacenters with 70 percent wind, solar, or hydropower energy by 2023, and in FY20, we extended that commitment companywide and to 100 percent by 2025. One method we use to respond to climate-related opportunities is our Sustainability Grants program, which drives climate-related energy and technology innovation; this program awarded more than $10 million in FY19 to projects or programs focused on better managing climate-related business activity.* , X Download here *italics denotes new disclosures not included in 2020 CDP Response ,\n",
      "Table: Table_1\n\n,Key area Description of work , Source location ,\nIdentification and assessment of climate- related risks Subject matter leadership on climate change risk resides with our Environmental Sustainability (ES) team, led by our Chief Environmental Officer. This team assesses Microsoft's climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities across the business portfolio using quantitative and qualitative scenario analysis, along with other risk assessments (including the use of internal company methods). The results from these analyses are assessed and validated through consultation with subject matter experts across the company and then used to inform Microsoft's formal, robust, and rigorous enterprise risk assessment process led by the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. The ERM program's formal risk assessment process is used to assess the size, scope, financial impact, and relative significance of any risk that Microsoft may face, today and into the future, including those related to climate change. The process involves categorizing risks according to their inherent impact on a scale of 1 (minimal) to 5 (critical) in four categories: trust or reputational; operational scope; legal, compliance, or environmental; and enterprise value. Risks are then rated according to their inherent likelihood on a scale of 1 (remote) to 5 (expected). These two ratings are used to produce an inherent risk score and are then aggregated with a management action/control effectiveness rating for a residual risk calculation. , X Download here ,\nOrganizational processes for managing climate risks The quantitative climate risks analysis focused on seven climate physical hazards (chronic temperature increase effects on energy demand, extreme temperatures, heat storms or waves, sea level rise, flood intensity, drought frequency, and drought length) in 2030 and 2060 and several transition risks and opportunities (energy efficiency, energy resilience, materials efficiency, renewable price stability, water efficiency, employee impacts from climate change).* , *italics denotes new disclosures not included in 2020 CDP Response ,\nProcesses for identifying, assessing, and managing risks in risk management strategy To determine our enterprise risks related to climate change, we use our enterprise risk management (ERM) risk prioritization criteria in the context of business continuity and service resilience, which include the scope of impact (e.g. reputational, regulatory, and cost), potential return on investment, and time and resources required to implement changes. An example of a physical risk managed through this process is the risk of facility damage from an acute weather event, such as flooding. To mitigate this risk, the Microsoft Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) program uses its relevant standards to help ensure the existence of effective, reliable, well-tested plans, systems, and processes during such a disruptive event to support the continuity and resilience of business operations and services and minimize adverse impacts.

      "Table: Table_1\n\n,Key area Description of work , Source location ,\nMetrics for assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities From July 2012, we began charging a fee based on the emissions associated with our operations. In FY19 (the reporting period), we applied the carbon fee to Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 business air travel emissions across the company. As of FY21, the carbon fee will apply to all Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, with the Scope 3 fee starting at a lower amount and increasing to meet the Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 business air travel fee over time. Our internal carbon fee isn't a \"shadow fee\" that is calculated but not charged. Our fee is paid by each division in our business based on its carbon emissions, and the funds are used to pay for sustainability improvements. By charging business groups based on the emissions they generate, we help to drive efficiency initiatives and innovation across our business. The carbon fee affects investment decisions by providing an incentive, the financial justification, and in some cases the funds for climate-related energy and technology innovation. The fee also helps drive culture change by raising internal awareness of the environmental implications of our business and establishing an expectation for environmental and climate responsibility within the company. In FY19, the carbon fee fund was used to support investments in: - 8,741,807 MWh in renewable electricity globally (the US portion of which earned Microsoft the US EPA Green Power Partnership as the number two US purchaser). - Offset purchases in five countries to reduce more than 750,000 mtCO2e, preserve forests, and grow the low-carbon economy in developing nations. - Technology innovation projects that formed the basis of our Al for Earth program. - More than 50 internal emissions reduction and energy efficiency projects. , X Download here ,\nDisclosure of GHG emissions and risks We annually disclose our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions as part of CDP and sustainability reporting. We also annually disclose our water consumption as part of our CDP and sustainability reporting. Through our Reporting Hub, we also disclose our annual data factsheets with environmental indicators covering: (1) greenhouse gas emissions (absolute values and normalized by revenue), (2) energy use, (3) carbon neutrality and greenhouse gas emissions balanced by carbon offsets, (4) water metrics including withdrawals, consumption, and discharge, (5) waste generation, and (6) electricity consumption. , X Download here ,\n"
